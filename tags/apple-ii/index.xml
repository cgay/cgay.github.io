      <description>(This post was converted from the original with minimal changes. Some links were removed because the targets were missing and I replaced the section about the Apple2Oasis emulator with the in-browser scullinsteel emulator.)
In 1982-3 I wrote an arcade style game for the Apple II called Millenium Leaper and sold it to a disk magazine called Softdisk. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much about it again until in 2007 I was having a conversation with someone about old computer games and it occurred to me to search for references to it on the net.</description>
