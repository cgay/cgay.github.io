Reminders for my sieve-like brain...

The site setup is a bit odd but I wanted the original sources and the generated
code to be in one repository. The generated code has to be in the top-level
directory, because that's where github.io will serve from, and putting the
original sources in a subdirectory didn't work out well (hugo complained).

The generated files are (at a minimum):

    404.html
    ananke
    categories
    images
    index.html
    index.xml
    posts
    sitemap.xml
    tags

And the rest are original source, either written by me (mostly in
content/posts) or generated by Hugo once and then edited by me.

To regenerate the site, run hugo in this directory, as follows:

    hugo --destination .

To run the local server:

    hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 --baseUrl http://50.116.53.62:1313/
